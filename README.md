## **Introduction**
The main objective of this demo is discussing on how to bring understanding to a system that is fundamentally not understandable.

## **Chaos Engineering**

Started back in the days in Netflix and amazon moving to datacenter to cloud public provider aws specifically (chaos monkey to simian army)

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.

Chaos engineering started in 2010 during Netflix migration to cloud infrastructure. Netflix engineers decided to develop a suite called Chaos Monkey to test various failure conditions and ensure customer experience.

Later on, Simian Army (a Chaos Monkey evolution) included tools to test AWS infrastrucure and services resiliency againsts failures such as disabling an AWS region, dropping an availability zone, simulating network delays and outages, etc.

## **Litmus Chaos**
Litmus is a Chaos Engineering Kubernetes native tool which provides for exhaustive experiments support for testing containers, pods, and nodes. It has good documentation for each of its experiment and also provides a GitHub repository of experiments, open for public contribution.

Its main advantages are:
- Components declared as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CDRs)
- Plenty of out of the box experiments
- Experiments SDK available in Go, Ansible and Python. 
- Chaos Portal GUI 
- Integration with CICD tools
- Experiment metrics can be imported to Prometheus.
